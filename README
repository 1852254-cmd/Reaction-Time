Basic plan:

Sketch a recreation of the baton dropper in cmu cs academy
Have the batons be an object that can be “dropped”
Dropping just means it lowers at a certain rate
The player has a bucket or some other containment thing at the bottom of the screen
The player has to move the bucket under the baton before it falls off the screen
Player input from arrow keys or mouse movement

Outline

Dropper class:
Holds the baton objects in a list
Selects a random baton from the list
Calls that baton’s drop method and removes it from the list

Baton class:
Has position attributes
Has a dropped attribute that determines if it moves down onStep
Has a drop method to change dropped attribute
Has a method to check if it has fallen off screen, in that case delete it

Grabber class:
Has a points attribute
Has a collision method to check for baton catches, if so add points

Who does what
I’ll do dropper class and graphics
Please do baton and grabber
